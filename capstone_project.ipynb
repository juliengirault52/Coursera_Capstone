    "# Find your Favourite Tube Station before Moving to London!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Project introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many French people move from Paris to London to improve their English and live a new experience there.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is the best place they should choose for settling down?\n",
    "\n",
    "When moving to a new city, one will likely choose their new address based on public transports: they will search the lines that can bring them quickly and directly from their new home to their office.\n",
    "\n",
    "__\"London tube\" and \"Paris métro\" public transports are comparably big with approximately 400 stations__... So here is the question that comes next: how can one know the kind of surroundings they are likely to find around each station? How can they decide where to settle down? Which station should they prefer with so many possibilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project gives French newcomers the opportunity to find the list of tube stations in London that best fit their taste, based on a comparison with something they already know: Paris's metro stations!\n",
    "\n",
    "For each London tube station, we expose a list of Paris stations that are similar. Here is a full report describing how this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find this full report and corresponding source code in [my jupyter notebook of the project on my github account here](https://github.com/juliengirault52/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/capstone_project.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two data entities for this project, here is a short description for both of them to help the reader have a quick understanding:\n",
    "### Stations coordinates\n",
    "For this project, I downloaded the transports stations coordinates released by the public services for both London [1] and Paris [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "### List of venues available around each stations\n",
    "To compare the stations, I used the data available via the Foursquare API for each station coordinates, exploring the list of venues reachable within a five-minute walk (300 meters).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of the project was __to mix all stations of both London and Paris cities and cluster them__. The comparision of the stations had to be based only on the services offered in their surroundings (i.e. without taking into account the location). And finally when able to compare, create groups of stations that are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why need an AI algorithm?\n",
    "For a two-dimension problem, when one wants to create clusters, this can be done simply by visualizing the data and there is no need to use AI. But in our case, our dataset had about 400 features, which means about 400 dimensions! Even after trying simplifying the data, which will be covered later in the report, there still was more than 200 features. This is why we needed to use a clustering algorithm to reach the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### London-Paris \"city-balance\": an adhoc quality score\n",
    "One of the risks was that the clusters would regroup stations only from the same city (Paris or London). To make sure that the resulting clusters would regroup a balanced quantity of stations from each city, I computed a \"balance score\". The score must be as low as possible. It is the distance to 50% for the ratio \"number of stations of Paris\" / \"total number of stations\" (*score=abs(0.50-np/nl)*).\n",
    "ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cluster Labels-3 cities-balance score: 0.3574861584519108 inertia: 89.97750663333983\n",
    "Cluster Labels-4 cities-balance score: 0.34106974568562276 inertia: 86.00200658957111\n",
    "Cluster Labels-5 cities-balance score: 0.34197384655531804 inertia: 82.58403862899996\n",
    "Cluster Labels-6 cities-balance score: 0.37053549083395193 inertia: 79.11207334558907\n",
    "Cluster Labels-7 cities-balance score: 0.37329728602870704 inertia: 77.13651635333981\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Data preparation\n",
    "#### Categories comparison\n",
    "A manual job was useful to increase the matching of venues categories between Paris and London. For instance, I needed to transform \"Pizza Place\" (which figured only in London) to \"Italian Restaurant\", or there was also very specific data such as \"Auvergne Restaurant\" that became \"Restaurant\". And of course the English \"Pub\" and French \"Bistro\" needed to be turned to a more generic naming: \"Bar\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, I created a \"categories_to_merge.csv\" with an ordered list of the most common categories and identified which ones were unbalanced between London and Paris.\n",
    "#### Data simplification\n",
    "To reduce features, I kept only the categories that were in the N-top categories. This allowed having about 250 features instead of 402.\n",
    "\n",
    "### why use the k-means algorithm? (iterating and selecting the best score)\n",
    "One of the \"k-means clustering\" algorithm advantages is that one can chose how many clusters will be created at the beginning of the process. Using the \"k-means clustering\" algorithm was a good way to iterate in order to get the best \"city-balance\" quality score. As a matter of facts, in that algorithm we know that the highest number of clusters you create, the more similar the stations will be. But on the other hand, we wished to get the best balance as possible so I chose to run multiple times the algorithm and save the best balance result. This was a good way to get the perfect equilibrium between similarity and \"city balance\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "Here are the two maps generated by the clustering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discussion\n",
    "Although we used k-means for its advantage explained above, it could be interesting to run a DBSCAN algorithm to see how many clusters it would compute. DBSCAN does not require to specify the number of clusters and find the best fitting number. After this is done, it would also be interesting to see what London-Paris \"city-balance\" score this would give.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "It is amasing how clustering can help to distinguish clusters when data is very complex. Now let's hope that this London tube list will help people who move to find the place where they will settle down!\n"
